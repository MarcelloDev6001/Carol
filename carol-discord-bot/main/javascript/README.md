# Carol

Here's the full source code for the Carol Bot for Discord

### Before you run the code, you need to do some silly things:

1. Create a file called `config.json` and put this inside the file:

```js
{
	"clientId": BOT_CLIENT_ID,
	"guildId": YOUR_GUILD_ID (or leave it blank),
	"token": YOUR_TOKEN,
	"command_running_message": "Carol est√° pensando...",
	"prefix": "c."
}
```
